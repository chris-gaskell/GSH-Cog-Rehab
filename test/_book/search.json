    "text": "Thank you for attending and welcome to the memory support skills group. This group has been designed for people who are experiencing difficulties with their memory. By participating in this group programme we hope that you will learn more about your difficulties and develop some strategies to help you manage these difficulties. The aims of the group are listed below:\nWe hope that the memory support skills group will also provide you with a space to share your experiences, knowledge and skills. It can be daunting coming together within a group and it’s perfectly natural to feel worried or anxious about attending and talking within a group. It is therefore important that we support one another and contribute as much or as little as we feel comfortable with. The emphasis of this group is active participation and it is equally important to contribute as much as you feel you can. It is also important that you attend all the sessions, however, if for some reason you can’t attend the group could you please let us know at least 24 hours in advance.\nThere will be the opportunity for you to complete some work out-of-session if you wish to. This is not compulsory, but may be helpful when thinking together about which strategies might help you manage your difficulties. Please also be aware that this group is not about ‘solving’ memory problems but developing strategies to help us to cope with our difficulties. It can take time to find the strategies that work for you, to implement these and for these to become effective. So it’s important that we take an explorative approach with trial and error.\nSometimes attending groups can cause us to have difficult thoughts and feelings. If you have any difficulties please feel able to arrange a time to discuss this with Grace Sunerton. I will endeavour to be available for telephone consultation on 01782 275188 to support you if you are having difficulties with the programme. There will also be space to ask any questions and explore with us your difficulties within the group if you feel comfortable sharing these."

We will explore some of these in more detail below; however, for the purpose of this group we will not cover all cognitive abilities. We all have our strengths as well as areas we find more difficult. Some of you may have completed a cognitive assessment before attending this group which helps us to identify these strengths and areas of difficulty.\nThe image below shows the different types of abilities:\n\n\n\nAn overview of the different types of cognitive functions."

However, it can help to have a few ‘ground rules’ to ensure that everyone feels as comfortable as possible and to help the group run smoothly.\nThis can also help to ensure that everyone has chance to contribute to the group. Is there anything that you would suggest could help the group to run smoothly? Feel free to make a note of any group rules agreed upon in the space below."

Attention describes the process through which you select something to concentrate on, filter out distractions, maintain concentration and switch it when necessary.\nTypes of Attention:\n\n1.2.1 Focused or selective attention\nThis is your ability to choose something to pay attention to while filtering out and ignoring other stimuli like noise.\n\n\n1.2.2 Sustained attention\nThis is your ability to keep concentrating on something over a period of time.\n\n\n1.2.3 Divided attention\nThis your ability to pay attention to more than one thing at the same time.\n\n\n1.2.4 Alternating attention\nThis your ability to switch your attention between two or more tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow are people with attention difficulties affected?\n\n\n\n\nI find it hard to do more than one thing at a time like writing a message while talking on the phone.\nMy mind often wanders when I read or watch TV. I’ll get to the end of a programme or page and have no idea what I read or watched.\nI start doing something but then get distracted and start doing something else. Then I can’t remember what I was meant to be doing."

We often talk about speed of information processing which refers to how quickly people are able to do this. For some people this may have slowed down which means that they find it hard to take new information in, especially when they’re trying to concentrate on lots of different things at once. Imagine that your mind works a bit like a computer."

Equally, if you’re using one programme it might be overloaded with information. The same can happen with our minds, especially for people who have reduced speed of information processing. If you overload your mind, information might not go in properly."
